Regression models are fitted on the whole inventory dataset to predict the tree diameter distribution of the LiDAR dataset. Later, this density distribution is bias corrected on compartment level.\\

The initial problem regarding this estimation lied within the sparsity of variables.
A regression model can only use variables which exist in both datasets (LiDAR \& inventory data).\\

During the first half of this study, only the tree height and geographical position of each tree existed within the LiDAR
dataset. Further important variables were later acquired and provided by ForestEye Research GmbH \& Co. KG. An overview can be
found in Table \ref{tab:variables}.\\

Therefore, two different approaches for the regression model were developed. The regression model tackling
sparsity can be found in the Appendix, providing an alternative approach for studies which have only the height and geographical position of trees.\\

The final model is discussed in the following Sections.
