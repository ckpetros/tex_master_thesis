Multivariate distributions consist of the marginal distributions and the dependence structure between those marginals. These components can be specified separately in a single framework with the help of copula functions. This chapter introduces the concept of modelling such dependence structures with copulas, which is the main focus of this thesis. The core elements on this subject were picked up from \cite{mcneil2015quantitative} and \cite{Ruppert2015}.
