  abstract  = {Copulas are a popular framework for both defining multivariate distributions and modeling multivariate data. A copula characterizes the dependence---and only the dependence---between the components of a multivariate distribution; they can be combined with any set of univariate marginal distributions to form a full joint distribution. Consequently, the use of copulas allows us to take advantage of the wide variety of univariate models that are available.},
