This chapter introduces some statistical methods used during the conduction of this thesis. Basic notations regarding mathematical foundations of statistics (such as linear algebra, probability theory, hypothesis testing etc) are skipped. Theoretical aspects regarding copulas and dependences structures will be introduced separately in Chapter \ref{sec:copulas_and_dependence_structures}.
%The chapter starts off with some fundamental notions on generalized linear models and arrives at a brief introduction to additive models
