Starting the dependence modelling on the key category cluster level, we will be aiming for obtaining separate estimations of pairwise correlations over time, as we only have 3 nodes on this level and manual approximation is feasible on this low number of dimensions. Since large outliers are involved and we assume to be dealing with tail dependence, we use Kendall's $\tau$ rank correlation coefficients (see Section \ref{ssec:rank_correlation}).
