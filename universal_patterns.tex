As mentioned in Section \ref{ssec:data_sources}, the data contains the information about sold articles over the years 2017 and 2018. \autoref{fig:total_sold_articles_ts} shows the weekly course for the quantities over those two years, highlighting active promotion weeks as vertical lines. We can undoubtedly recognize that \textit{"Black Friday"} weeks (black vertical lines) have an exceptional impact on sales, as they stand internationally for the most busy shopping periods. During these days in mid- to late November each year, large amounts of different products are heavily discounted.

Another promotion type we are interested in is \textit{"Friends \& Family"}, occurring yearly around April-May and October, where on the eCom website plenty of articles are available for reduced prices. On these weeks, we have elevated numbers of sold articles as well (blue vertical lines). Tables \ref{tab:promotion_weeks} and \ref{tab:promotion_weeks} show the weeks were Black Friday and Friends \& Family took place respectively. The dates on those tables are one week apart each and they always indicate the Monday of the respective week (which is the European standard).

\autoref{fig:promos_against_sales} depicts scatterplots of 10,000 randomly chosen observations in the dataset, where the two main promotion intensities are plotted against article unit sales. An overall positive relationship is visible as we would expect, even more so for Black Friday. Due to the huge noise persisting in these relationships however, Pearson's correlation coefficient for Black Friday against sales and Friends \& Family against sales take on values of 0.32 and 0.11 respectively. Notice the high concentration of different sale quantities when there is neither Black Friday nor Friends \& Family promotion activity (vertical points on the y-axes of \autoref{fig:promos_against_sales}). Similar behavioural conclusions can be made about the total markdown percentage, with a correlation coefficient of 0.27 (see \autoref{fig:markdown_against_logsales}). The type of season (Fall-Winter (FW) or Spring-Summer (SS)) doesn't seem to make an overall difference in the sale quantities, as a glimpse at \autoref{fig:season_type_against_logsales} points out (at least for modelling purposes as discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:modelling}).

Regarding the months, they don't seem to differ much in their sale quantities, that is of course excluding the months of the two mentioned promotion types. The monthly sales portions for those months can be observed in \autoref{fig:sales_without_promo_months}. We have slightly higher sale portions on January, June and July. 
Most probably this is due to Christmas and "end of the year" shopping habits, which are carried forward from December to the very next month January. 
Regarding June and July, they indicate summer periods and frequent occurrence of big sports events, which may drive sales. 
Notice that, despite the fact that December is not explicitly present in \autoref{tab:promotion_weeks}, it is nonetheless a Black Friday month as the promotion is still activated moving from November to December (see \autoref{fig:monthly_ts}).

Moving forward, reviewing some sale summary statistics along with the findings so far, we detect a very high overdispersion in our data. The first two rows in \autoref{tab:quantiles_sold_units_week} give as a first impression of the sales' distribution. Considering the sold units of one article at a time within a week, there are lots of weeks where no single unit was sold. The median is at 2.71 units,\footnote{Reminder from Section \ref{ssec:data_sources}: the values are in reality discrete, but due to anonymization they were transformed into real numbers.} 75\% of the "article-week" combinations take on a value of at most 20 and the minority exceeds 100 pieces (99\%-quantile). The third row of the table shows how many distinct articles fall under the respective quantile of sales and there is a visible anti-proportional behaviour towards the number of sold units. Remarkable though is the quantity of affected articles even for incredibly large quantiles.

Therefore, we inspect the number of weekly sold units above and below a certain (large) threshold to find out how promotions influence these vast sale numbers. In \autoref{fig:bar_below_200_units_week} we can see how the sales are distributed over Black Friday, Friends \& Family and regular weeks for below a threshold of 200 units. Most high sale occurrences are not attached to any of the two big promotions. They might be due to other events or unrelated to any campaigns altogether. Observations above that threshold of 200 can be seen in \autoref{fig:bar_above_200_units_week} and we can clearly see a change from \autoref{fig:bar_below_200_units_week}. As expected, Black Friday is the dominating promotion type, although the majority remains in not promoted article sales.\\

\end{figure}


To validate the exploration on this, we may look at the empirical \ac{CDF} in \autoref{fig:ecdf_all} using all observations now.
Instances with no promotions have a steeper curve (red line) and reach their maximum faster compared to articles tagged with a promotion in a certain week. The less concave curve of Friends \& Family promoted sales (blue line) implies that there are more instances with a larger amount of sold units overall. The same behaviour is even more pronounced for Black Friday (black line), having considerably more high quantity instances. Along these lines, promotions might somewhat explain this pattern better.\\

Unfortunately, such outliers with extreme sale numbers should not be removed from the dataset, as it would produce gaps in the time series of some specific articles. Removing entire articles from the analysis is also not an option at this point, since we would be forced to remove a lot of articles.
%There will be a data delimitation process down the line to deal with this issue (see Subsection \ref{sssec:data_delimitation}). 
For example, 273 articles alone would have to be removed to get rid of the highest 0.01\% of quantities (see \autoref{tab:quantiles_sold_units_week}). Besides, these extreme values might be too informative for the underlying data generating process, so no removal of instances is employed to the dataset.
