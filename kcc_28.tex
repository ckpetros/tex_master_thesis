The same strategy as in the previous Subsection \ref{sssec:kcc_26} shall be followed. In \autoref{fig:scatter_res_kcc_28} a lower tail dependence can be suspected. Whether both positive and negative dependence are hiding in the the data will be tested beforehand, so that we can narrow down the number of plausible copula families.

A \ac{GJRM} approach equivalent to Model \ref{eq:gjrm_formula_26} will be applied here and we can see the summary in R output \ref{output:summary_kcc_28}. All model parameters but the copula parameter are set as constants. We first examine copulas which account for positive as well as negative dependencies with the help of the \textit{BiCopSelect()} function. The t-copula is again the most appropriate within a set of copula families including the independence copula, the Gaussian copula, the Student's t-copula and the Frank copula. Looking at equation 6 of the output, we can see that time has a significant effect on $\hat{\theta}$ and its partial smooth effect can be checked visually in \autoref{fig:time_effect_on_theta_28}.

The parsimonious model setup produces a nice fit (see \autoref{fig:res_hist_qqplot_28}) so we proceed to analyzing the correlation parameter. Once again, $\hat{\theta}$ takes on positive as well as negative values interchangeably over time periods. Therefore considering further copula families like the Clayton copula would be arguably inappropriate.

%On this \ac{KCC} pair, the \ac{GJRM} approach is not as favorable as in the pair KCC 2 \& KCC 6, though it might be considered acceptable (\autoref{fig:margin_estimates_kcc_28}).  \\

%This circumstance is reflected within the comparison of the "gamCopula" estimated dependence measures. The overall similarity between the two lines in \autoref{fig:copula_parameters_28}, which depict the time-dependent correlation parameters of this pair, is given. However, the details reveal that there are severe differences between the estimation methods. As the gamCopula approach yields converge in contrast to the \ac{GJRM} method, it might be preferential. Nevertheless, the results should be treated with adequate caution.

%The stretched sign change of the correlation over time happens, just like in the previous pair, from June to August 2017. The curves here are surprisingly different in terms of their stability. The gamCopula method seems to have a more stable course compared to the \ac{GJRM} approach. The red line in \autoref{fig:copula_parameters_28} appears very sensitive in very short time intervals.
