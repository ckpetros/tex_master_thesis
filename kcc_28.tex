On this \ac{KCC} pair, the \ac{GJRM} approach is not as favorable as in the pair KCC 2 \& KCC 6, though it might be considered acceptable (\autoref{fig:margin_estimates_kcc_28}).  \\

This circumstance is reflected within the comparison of the "gamCopula" estimated dependence measures. The overall similarity between the two lines in \autoref{fig:copula_parameters_28}, which depict the time-dependent correlation parameters of this pair, is given. However, the details reveal that there are severe differences between the estimation methods. As the gamCopula approach yields converge in contrast to the \ac{GJRM} method, it might be preferential. Nevertheless, the results should be treated with adequate caution.

The stretched sign change of the correlation over time happens, just like in the previous pair, from June to August 2017. The curves here are surprisingly different in terms of their stability. The gamCopula method seems to have a more stable course compared to the \ac{GJRM} approach. The red line in \autoref{fig:copula_parameters_28} appears very sensitive in very short time intervals.
