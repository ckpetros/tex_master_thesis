\textit{Dependence measures} allow us to summarize a particular kind of dependence into a single number in the bivariate case.
% Recall the Fr\'echet-Hoeffding bounds (\autoref{eq:frechet_hoeffding_lower} and \autoref{eq:frechet_hoeffding_upper}). They are an example of such kind of dependence measures. After all, they represent perfect negative or positive dependence.
In this section, we take a closer look into three classes of dependence measures along with appropriate association metrics.
