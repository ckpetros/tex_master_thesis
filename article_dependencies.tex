In Section \ref{ssec:kcc_copulas}, dependence structures over time for aggregate sets of sales data have been analyzed and measures of dependence (or concordance) were sought after, usually in the context of correlation with values between -1 and 1, indicating the magnitude. Parametric approaches were performed to obtain comprehensible results. However, entering the lowest level of granularity of target objects, namely the individual articles themselves (see \autoref{fig:article_hierarchy}), there are some heavy drawbacks as discussed in Section \ref{ssec:individual_patterns}.
