Dependence structures over time for aggregate sets of sales data have been analyzed so far and measures of dependence (or concordance) were sought after, usually in the context of correlation with values between $-1$ and $1$ indicating the magnitude. Parametric approaches were performed to obtain comprehensible results. However, entering the lowest level of granularity of target objects, namely the individual articles themselves (see \autoref{fig:article_hierarchy}), there are some heavy drawbacks as discussed in Section \ref{ssec:individual_patterns}.
\\

Within the scope of Section \ref{ssec:kcc_copulas}, an important aspect needs to be taken into consideration. That is the well known fact that correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, other frameworks which enable us to detect causal effects and maybe even allow approximate quantification\footnote{e.g. Sales transferability from one article to another (over time).} shall be briefly discussed in this Section and serve as possible directions for further investigation.
