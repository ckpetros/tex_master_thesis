On the lowest product hierarchy level, the number of unique articles is quite large for models to handle. In \autoref{tab:articles_per_kcc}, we can see that our key category clusters of interest, 2, 6 and 8, have 1587, 9746 and 2012 articles respectively. Although we only work on those \acp{KCC}, even advanced techniques like vine copulas are struggling to handle such dimensions. \\

We have to take into consideration different models for each group. On top, further data delimitation shall reduce the dimensionality even further. Referring back to \autoref{tab:transactional_data}, we know that our last week of observation is "2018-12-24". We will restrict ourselves to articles that were not taken off the assortment before that date because they will most probably not be put back for sale.\footnote{We neglect the possibility of an item to return in the future.} After setting these boundaries, we arrive at a considerably smaller magnitude shown in \autoref{tab:articles_per_kcc_after_max_week}. \\
